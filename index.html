                    Right so while on my recent trip to the North <i>( not to the Wall ! )</i>
                    after lots' of fun <i>( exaggeration is overrated )</i> and a day of pretty ritualistic pooja, I decided to go actually high and take a trip to Nainital.
                    I mean after having multiple people known and unknown claim to know you so well <i>(Seriously the North remembers !)</i> that you begin to doubt your identity;
                    you would need a break too !!!
                    Well dad informed me a day in advance about our plans and hmm there wasn't really anything to prepare or such.
                    So plan was to leave next morning bright and early after lunch <i>( lunch here is like 9-10AM - that's bright and early. )</i>
                    <br><br>
                    This feels like the right place to introduce Nainital.
                    It's also called as city of lakes and as far as I am aware in close vicinity altogether there are 7 lakes-type geographics in this region.
                    Nonetheless I only visited Nainital on this trip. Ok so here comes morning ! Bright and early eh !!!
                    <b> nopee</b> not really ! ... I woke up next morning to drastic rains.
                    It was literally a torrent <i>( not the site )</i> and with fear of land-slides in mountains blocking road kept us safely locked in. :(
                    <br><br>
                    Well not like the rains were gonna hold back a brave heart like me ! ... So blazingly I stepped out of house any way at around 1pm finally
                    <sub><i><b>( Only after rains stopped )</b></i></sub> and we departed. Here is an interesting note I made as I sat in my Bua's car about the damaged condition of the car.
                    Apparently as per claims of my dad and well other relatives too, there is not a single car new or old without scratches or bumps and bends in it's body
                    in entire city of Haldwani. <i>(Haldwani is kinda at base of mountains and Nainital is at top btw.)</i>

                    So I was pretty amazed right from start of our trip. Uttarakhand is a mountainous place and is filled with areas like forest and mountains completely green
                    with shrubs and herbs all with names I cannot remember. Last time I visited this place was 8 years ago. My trusted companion for photography back then was an awesome
                    camera given to me by my parents. It did not have any flash, it was bright sparkly red and could take about 32/36 photos in one reel. It was just funny to remember
                    how restrictive it was back then and I had to be careful to take only good pics. Nonetheless free from limits this time i snapped the pics of most random things including a street dog for no reason at all :p
                    <br>
                    The above pic was taken just after we left Haldwani city area and started heading towards the ghats.

                    Soon enough we were within the range that we could see clouds rolling down the mountain slopes in close vicinity.

                    Finally for last part before Nainital we headed directly into the clouds themselves.
                    It was a sight to behold as we made our way up further. There was mist everywhere almost !
                    I was repeatedly corrected that there is a difference between mist and actually being inside a cloud.
                    <i>( I am still not very certain but apparently being inside a cloud is more pure while mist is because of dust etc. )</i>
                    Well just around here on the slopes there was a popular stall for <i>Bhuna Bhutta - (corn) - Bhatji ki Dukan</i>.
                    Lol fact is we did not stop on way up and it was closed on our way down :p .
                    Nonetheless we still stopped in the last area before the trip and took some cool pics.
                    The road was quite empty so well... why not sit on the road right? And that I did :p

                             A single root of this tree burned at one end would continue burning slowly and just carrying few such twigs would allow u to cross the mountains.</p>

                    Finally on arriving at Nainital the most prominent of all awesome things is the large awesome Lake in middle.
                    The two sides of the lakes are called Talli-Tal <i>(Talli- in Pahari means lower)</i> and Malli-Tal <i>(Malli- In Pahari means upper)</i>. Previously one could take boat from one end to other. Unfortunately that no longer happens.
                    Boats on respective sides only take half circle of the lake and return.
                    The road encircling the lake on one side is flat and runs around it's cicumference while on other side the road rises up high and then goes down.
                    The road encricling the lake is very very popular by itself and as a shopping stop ! It's called <i>Maal Road</i>.
                    Arriving here we headed straight to my Bua's house. She is a doctor in government service and the bunglow assigned to her by government for residence
                    is one of the old-style bunglows built by British. The house had quite some antiquities like old-style switches and a fire-place out of use.
                    Just in the area outside house. Although not planned but due to rains had many multi-colored flowers growing which amazed me. Most flowers were variants of Dahlia but well you can never be sure 0.0

                    This place is the Mallital Bazaar. Currently it's still very popular and has the favourite shops of most of my relatives.
                    The shopkeepers have a unique selling style. They rely on relationship of trust and family-like aquaintance with their customers.
                    Such as asking welfare of family members, day-to-day work questions and customers asking like-wise. Raw materials like clothing materials etc. being purchased then stiched is a popular trend.
                    There were plenty of clothing shops along this road. Along the road were also quite a few novelty style store where tourists could purchase novelites like special styled-wax-candles.
                    Although there is a rush in area by boat-keepers or travel agents to take you on a ride.... (quite literally for ur money :p). But as soon as either my Dad or anyone else spoke in local lagnuage,
                    most of them just instantly lost interest. That was almost comical.<br>
                    Another important note is at the end of this street is a small open-theatrical spot. where Ram-Leela used to be organized conventionally. The Ram-Leela held here is full of funny incidents and stories
                    like Ram or Hanuman taking a break in middle of the play or Ravan helping out some-times and the likes. Quite some local jokes and my Dad reminences visiting this place few times.

                    Now this was quite the place with some cool history of it's own. Our destination was Naina Devi temple but this comes along as a side-path to the temple and now this place is absolutely a part of the scenery.
                    <br>
                    Apparently When Tibet fell as an independent country people from Tibet fled and took refuge in other countries. Those who came over the mountains took refuge in this region. However as a source of livelihood they established such shops
                    And now this entire area is another tourist destination with it's own history to tell. Quite some antiquities, woolen cloth pieces, etc. sold in this region.
                    In the inside pic of the Tibetan Market below has a narrow lane, at end of that path is entrance to Naina Devi Temple.

                    This is a simple temple of Naina Devi. A regional diety and even though the temple is not much for aesthetics it has extremely high <i>Manyata i.e : Trust of people</i>.
                    People who visit this temple make wishes by tying colored cloth of trust for fulfillment of their wishes and most claim to have their wishes granted.
                    As a note of how trusted temples can be at times. Recently another temple nearby of Neem Karoli Baba has become famouse world-wide now after Mark-Zuckerberg claimed that he visited it in his time of distress for help.
                    Apart from it's religious significance the view of lake from the temple is magnificient. There was a small well-maintained nursery/ mini-garden of richly colorful and diverse flowers in the temple.
                    The temple is also the location for some yearly festivities celebrating the grace of diety with much fan-fare.

                        This is a popular sentiment at many temples in North and other places in India aswell.</p>

                    We went boating for awhile. Dad enjoyed rowing the boat all by himself and it was somewhat fun fact that the boat-keeper just sat aside.
                    We went some extra length till middle of lake since Dad himself was rowing. It was fun and then we arrived at the 'Last Stop' for the day.<br>
                    <b>Maal Road : </b> An equally popular part of Nainital as all others, Mall road is a very popular and fun place to shop, eat or just to take a leisurely walk along the lakeside.
                    The cool thing is it comes with it's own bit of history. This road is build in two levels. Originally there was a single very narrow paved road at higher level while the lower road was unpaved <i>Kaccha rasta</i>.
                    During British rule apparently the upper lane was specifically only for usage by British while the lower lane was for Indian public.
                    Apparently it also had a board restricting and specifying in mean manner the usage conditions. I am imagining Amitabh Bachan movie board here :p -> Indians and Dogs not allowed. No idea what movie that was actually though.
                    Nonetheless currently each road is single-side traffic and well-paved and smooth making it very convenient for tourists aswell as day-to-day traffic.
                    This road is closed daily 6pm-9pm. We missed the timing and in evening we had to choose road on other side of lake which goes even higher... brrrr that was cold that high up ! and then finally joins back down on same path.
                    The trip back was pretty un-eventful but foody <i>(just aloo-raita, Garam pakodi and tea, bhutta (i.e: corn) and an Indian variant of French Fries on Maal road)</i>  :p
